Is it possible that News can affect movements in the Sock Market?
In this project I was able to prove that it is true (to some degree). News information accounts only for
a very small portion of the Stock Market trend.

The main challenge of the project was finding a solution that can handle large amounts of information and solve
the problem fast.

With the strategy I used I was able to predict the trend correctly 65% of the time
and I think that understanding more about why I missed 45% of the time can help me improve these results in the future.

Thank you.
